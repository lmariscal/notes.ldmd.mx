# Review of Don't Make me Think

The book _Don't Make me Think_ written by _Steve Krug_ and first released in
2000 is a book about the usability both in web and in mobile devices. What is
interesting about this book, is how it proposes all the topics based on examples
that teach visually the idea behind this proposal. Together with this examples
it analyses the human psychology and how we humans tend to identify different
aspects of the UI both visually and by interaction.

The first chapter teaches about how to avoid making the user think, by making the
things the user interacts with both obvious and consistent. Steve Krug teaches
that nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away and to make
things self evident. This self evidence should be at a level where a user not
related to the app or website is still able to operate it and not be confused
about all the different aspects of it.

This same idea continues throughout the book by making the following rules
based on this idea, making things so the user does not have to think further
than basic usage of the product. Some other ways of clustering the users view is
for example the usage of needles words or instructions. Instructions for example
should be needles and things *should* be self evident and users usually will not
tend to read them any way.

Other important aspect of this is that it talks about the importance on
smartphones in the modern society and how it is no longer only to make calls an
receive messages. The smartphone is integrated into our daily lives and it has
become an important part of society, so much that we do use it to make even the
simplest tasks as buying groceries, calculator or even to hire someone to take
the dog for a walk. Based on this, it is indispensable to think of mobile users
no longer as an excluded group but as a native user of your application.

I personally think it is a great book for programmers as we usually tend to
avoid thinking about topics related to design or accessibility, when actually they
are critic to a proper deployment as users will end up either being swayed away
or attracted to your product depending on how much thought you put into it. As
previously discussed in class it is also important to think when the rules apply
as following all the rules letter by letter will make you end up with a dull
product. But as the saying goes, you must know the rules in order to break them.
