      <p>The book <em>Don’t Make me Think</em> written by <em>Steve Krug</em> and first released in 2000 is a book about the usability both in web and in mobile devices. What is interesting about this book, is how it proposes all the topics based on examples that teach visually the idea behind this proposal. Together with this examples it analyses the human psychology and how we humans tend to identify different aspects of the UI both visually and by interaction.</p>
      <p>The first chapter teaches about how to avoid making the user think, by making the things the user interacts with both obvious and consistent. Steve Krug teaches that nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away and to make things self evident. This self evidence should be at a level where a user not related to the app or website is still able to operate it and not be confused about all the different aspects of it.</p>
      <p>This same idea continues throughout the book by making the following rules based on this idea, making things so the user does not have to think further than basic usage of the product. Some other ways of clustering the users view is for example the usage of needles words or instructions. Instructions for example should be needles and things <em>should</em> be self evident and users usually will not tend to read them any way.</p>
      <p>Other important aspect of this is that it talks about the importance on smartphones in the modern society and how it is no longer only to make calls an receive messages. The smartphone is integrated into our daily lives and it has become an important part of society, so much that we do use it to make even the simplest tasks as buying groceries, calculator or even to hire someone to take the dog for a walk. Based on this, it is indispensable to think of mobile users no longer as an excluded group but as a native user of your application.</p>
      <p>I personally think it is a great book for programmers as we usually tend to avoid thinking about topics related to design or accessibility, when actually they are critic to a proper deployment as users will end up either being swayed away or attracted to your product depending on how much thought you put into it. As previously discussed in class it is also important to think when the rules apply as following all the rules letter by letter will make you end up with a dull product. But as the saying goes, you must know the rules in order to break them.</p>
